# Linkage Headers
Heavily stripped down GoldSrc SDKs Headers amalgamated into a single includes, adopted to work only with [YaPB](https://github.com/yapb/yapb "YaPB") code.

## ☉ About
Due to different licensing models between bot code and these headers, they are going into separate repository, to keep main bot repository clean out of non-MIT licensed code, if you have enough time, you can easily adapt bot to use standard HL/Metamod/Xash3D SDKs.
